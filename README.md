<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The goal of ERC721A is to provide a fully compliant implementation of IERC721 with significant gas savings for minting multiple NFTs in a single transaction. This project and implementation will be updated regularly and will continue to stay up to date with best practices.

The [Azuki](https://twitter.com/azukizen) team created ERC721A for its sale on 1/12/22. There was significant demand for 8700 tokens made available to the public, and all were minted within minutes. The network BASEFEE remained low despite huge demand, resulting in low gas costs for minters, while minimizing network disruption for the wider ecosystem as well.

For more information on how ERC721A works under the hood, please visit our [blog](https://www.azuki.com/erc721a). To find other projects that are using ERC721A, please visit [erc721a.org](https://www.erc721a.org) and our [curated projects list](https://github.com/chiru-labs/ERC721A/blob/main/projects.md).

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the contracts in the library by importing them:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "erc721a/contracts/ERC721A.sol";

contract Azuki is ERC721A {
  constructor() ERC721A("Azuki", "AZUKI") {}

  function mint(uint256 quantity) external payable {
    // _safeMint's second argument now takes in a quantity, not a tokenId.
    _safeMint(msg.sender, quantity);
  }
}

```
